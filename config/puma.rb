# This configuration file will be evaluated by Puma. The top-level methods that
# are invoked here are part of Puma's configuration DSL. For more information
# about methods provided by the DSL, see https://puma.io/puma/Puma/DSL.html.
#
# Puma starts a configurable number of processes (workers) and each process
# serves each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
#
# You can control the number of workers using ENV["WEB_CONCURRENCY"]. You
# should only set this value when you want to run 2 or more workers. The
# default is already 1.
#
# The ideal number of threads per worker depends both on how much time the
# application spends waiting for IO operations and on how much you wish to
# prioritize throughput over latency.
#
# As a rule of thumb, increasing the number of threads will increase how much
# traffic a given process can handle (throughput), but due to CRuby's
# Global VM Lock (GVL) it has diminishing returns and will degrade the
# response time (latency) of the application.
#
# The default is set to 3 threads as it's deemed a decent compromise between
# throughput and latency for the average Rails application.
#
# Any libraries that use a connection pool or another resource pool should
# be configured to provide at least as many connections as the number of
# threads. This includes Active Record's `pool` parameter in `database.yml`.
threads_count = ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS", 3)

# Specifies the `port` that Puma will listen on to receive requests; default is 3000.

# Allow puma to be restarted by `bin/rails restart` command.

# Run the Solid Queue supervisor inside Puma, so a single-server deployment needs
# no separate (paid) worker service. Split it out when the queue starts lagging.
#
# `:async` runs the supervisor in threads inside this process instead of forking.
# It is not just a preference: solid_queue 1.6's plugin predates Puma 8, and its
# forking path starts a monitor thread before Rails has loaded — which raises
# NoMethodError on nil.present? (ActiveSupport isn't loaded yet) and then
# NameError on SolidQueue itself. The async path defers all of that to
# after_booted, when the application is up.
#
# `plugin` comes first: it is what loads puma/plugin/solid_queue, and that file
# is what defines the solid_queue_mode DSL method.
# Run the Solid Queue supervisor inside Puma so a single-server deployment needs
# no separate (paid) worker service. Split it out when the queue starts lagging.
#
# preload_app! is load-bearing here, not an optimisation: without it Puma builds
# the Rack app lazily on the first request, so the plugin's on_booted hook fires
# before Rails exists and the supervisor dies with `uninitialized constant
# SolidQueue`. The web service stays up, jobs silently never run.
# `:async` runs the supervisor in threads in this process rather than forking a
# child. That costs less memory on a 512MB instance, and it avoids forking a
# process that already holds a PostgreSQL connection — which segfaults outright
# on macOS, making the whole arrangement untestable locally.
#
# `plugin` must come before `solid_queue_mode`: loading the plugin is what
# defines that DSL method.
